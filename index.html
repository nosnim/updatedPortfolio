                <p>I'm the very lucky husband of a wonderful wife and father of three delightful and precocious girls, ages
                    3, 8, and 10. Our baby and only boy is 18 months old and is the most easy-going baby I think I've ever
                    seen (luckily!). He is also a very curious kid, which means a lot of emptying out cabinets, closets,
                    bookshelves, garbage cans, and anything else that has anything that can hold his interest for 2 seconds.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I've always enjoyed working with computers and programming in particular. I'm currently enrolled in and taking
                    classes from the University of Utah's Web Development Boot Camp. Prior to this, I worked in the asset
                    management department of a large investment bank for ~6 1/2 years, managing the team whose job it was
                    to reconcile the desks' Futures, Options, and FX trades with our brokers. It was an enjoyable and interesting
                    job that kept me on my toes, but with an average of 60+ hrs per week, it was difficult maintaining the
                    work-life balance that my wife and I sought.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Upon completion of Web Development course, I plan to work with my brother-in-law and his cousin who design
                    and build web pages and currently have a backlog of work. I also plan to expand my coding knowledge into
                    back-end languages (Java, PHP, Python, etc.)
